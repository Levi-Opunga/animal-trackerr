# animal-trackerr
This is a spark application for recording details on animals and tracking them. This app utilises objects to display the data and the t-sql database to store the data. It allows a user to add an animal depending on whether it is endangered animal or a normal animal. It also allows a user to input sightings of animals. The app also allows a user to update the information on each entry and the user can also delete a particular entry or clear the database of entry fields.
